                <p>I only spent 5 years as a kid in Moldova. My mother is from the small region of Moldova called
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gagauzia" title="Gagauzia at Wikipedia">Gagauzia</a>.
                   Gagauzians are a cultural mix between Bulgarians and Turks. They are Orthodox but speak language
                   similar to Turkish. Off course I was never taught the Gagauzian language as a kid  which is too bad.
                   I have a lot of family in the region. I cherish childhood memories when I was visiting my
                   grandparents at their little farm estate during summer. Everybody would gather at the long
                   table under the grape vines for a long plentiful meal.
                </p>
                <p>Moldova is not exactly a touristy place. The only outstanding attraction there is -
                        <a href="http://www.milestii-mici.md/en" title="Milestii Mici Website">Milestii Mici</a> -
                   wine cellar that is registered in the Guinness World Records as the biggest wine collection in
                   the world.

                    <img class="even" src="moldova-view.jpg" alt="Moldovian Countryside View" />
                </a>
                <p>But the country has beautiful nature. You go up and down the hill nomatter where you drive.
                   It's farmland and vineyards as far as the eye can see. It is especially beautiful in July-August as all the
                   crops on the endless fields get ripe. You can see colourful strips and squares of yellow, green,
                   and brown. Part of the country is covered with dense forest.
                </p>
                <p>Wine making is a part of everybody's life here. You won't leave your friend's house without
                   tasting his home made wine. People are warm and welcoming in general. This is the place I
                   would certainly recommend to explore through an argiturismo steading. You will be able to
                   taste some delicious local home made food and pick up Moldovan folklore.
