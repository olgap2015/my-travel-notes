                <p>My name is Olga Ivancic.
                   I was born in Latvia which at the time was counting its last years as a part
                   of the Soviet Union. In the search of better life for the family my parents
                   moved twice - first to Moldova, then to Belarus. I think that set the mode
                   for me - I can't stop moving from country to country ever since!
                </p>
                <p>On my own I moved to Sicily, Italy where I got married, then to the United States.
                   I also spent vacation in Germany once. Some of these countries are popular travel
                   destinations while others aren't so much. I'd like to share with you my favorite
                   places to visit in each one of these countries.
