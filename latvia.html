                <p>I was born in Latvia in a small town of Salaspils. It's a shame to say that I
                   never visited after I moved from there. I always wanted to revisit but haven't
                   had a chance yet. So here I will talk about several places that I remember visiting
                   as a kid.
                   Latvia is a lively little European country these days. But even during the soviet
                   times it was considered a "little piece of Europe" in the soviet reality. We had better
                   made furniture, cute cafes and luxury to walk through the medieval streets of Riga, the
                   capital.

                <p>Riga has a lot to offer. It has a charming downtown, river in the middle, it's a port city
                   with access to the Baltic sea. From my childhood memories I recommend
                        <a href="http://rigazoo.lv/public/28923.html" title="Official Riga Zoo Website">Riga's Zoo</a>,
                        <a href="http://www.latvia.travel/en/sight/mezaparks" title="Mezaparks Information">Mezaparks</a>,
                        <a href="http://www.rct.lv/en/" title="Central Market Official Website">Central Market</a>
                   for foodies. Boat rides in the Gulf of Riga are awesome, too.
